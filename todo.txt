Missing feature list of sam2p
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Don't have too high hopes, probably they won't get implemented, unless
explicit motivaton arises.)

Please also see pending bugs on https://github.com/pts/sam2p/issues

All of these old bugs had a follow-up elsewhere, or they don't need one:
https://code.google.com/archive/p/sam2p/issues

TODO items:

* out-of-source build, discussion on:
  https://code.google.com/archive/p/sam2p/issues/15
  3. mkdir build 4. cd build 5. ../configure
* make mkdist-noautoconf create .tar.gz w/o leading directory part
* cannot read t.pnm "P4 1 1 1" doesn't end with \S
* ./sam2p ../pts.ppm t.gif -> sam2p: out_gif.cpp:260: void out_gif_write(GenBuffer::Writable&, Image::Indexed*): Assertion `bits_per_pixel<=8' failed.
* why so large PNG? sam2p examples/chessboard_ascii.pnm t.png
* easy seek back to 0 in in_*.cpp
* rxvt_bug.png -> useful Win98 .bmp
* --invert option, for tif22pnm users
* complete turbo tutorial
* MIFF input, _output_
* full BMP output compressed
* faster GIF input (?? isn't it fast enough?)
* make install, .deb (debhelper?), .rpm
* normal `image' instead of `colorimage'
* CUPS raster input and output
* /Background option (-bg) to change transparent pixels -> bg color
* LZW and ZIP compressed for indexed etc.
* parse bts2.ttt just after generating (balance of [ << ... >> ])
* command line option for /Transparent
* avoid 3 warnings in: ./sam2p examples/pts2.pbm t.ppm
* check for fixed bugs new zlib
* one-liner eliminate automatically invalid BMP SampleFormats with compression
* eliminate long line (>120) from l1fa85g.tte
* one-liner -s gray|indexed|rgb|transparent
* in-memory dump when scanf_dict Error
* optimal, non-mem-hungry RLE compression filter (hardly possible...)
* possibility to write RGB (non-YCbCr) JPEG with /Compression/IJG etc.
* ability to load .gz and .zip compressed input files. Example: .pbm.gz
* no return DONT_KNOW from *_work()
* Meta output
* PSL1 auto fallback to grayscale `image' in absence of `colorimage'
* full support for ZIP compression in PSL1 (similar to RLE)
* implement as a library (throw/catch exceptions, memory management, reentrance)
* check for proper inner dict usage in l1fa85g.tte
* add /Transparent2, /Transparent4, /Transparent8 for PDF
* add all #warning REQUIRES:
* show binary/ASCII in PDF and PS header comments
* `available loaders: (TIFF)' if tifftopnm not found (run-time)
* make LZW-unsupported not an Error, but a Warning
* create output profile
* GIF reader is too slow (maybe LZW reading? ?). Change to xvgif.c??
* run-time detect the absence of external progs
* make install
* make .deb, .rpm
* (Not going to happen.) NDEBUG by default
* substitute char (1) for bool (8) on Digital UNIX
* run-time choice from FlateEncode filter implemenetations etc.
* convert bilevel indexed image to grayscale more quickly
* (Not going to happen.) read external .tte files (runtime) instead of built-in .tth
* possibility to store several profiles in the same .jib file
* real, PDF-style dates into Created, Produced
* enforce magic numbers for .job and .jib files
* (early check, special handler) make everything work when wd==0 || ht==0; especially encoding filters
* better Job option for specifying and removing transparent color (better than /Transparent)
* log date(now)
* support LargeBBox
* support Comment
* support PDF metadata: Title Subject Author Creator Producer
* support PDF dates: Created Produced
* support Comment
* add PAM file format support from NetPBM
* pre-transformation: making grayscale
* pre-transformation: down-bit-sampling
* pre-transformation: down-palette-sampling (``generate optimal palette'')
* tif22pnm warning - non-square pixels; to fix do a 'pnmscale -yscale nan'  P6 2840 2138 255
